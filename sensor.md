# SENSORS
## 1. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MODULE
**Introduction**
In this tutorial we will learn how to use a DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
Itâ€™s accurate enough for most projects that need to keep track of humidity and
temperature readings.
Again we will be using a Library specifically designed for these sensors that will make our
code short and easy to write.
